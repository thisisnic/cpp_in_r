# C++ in R

Repository contents:

* [`./cpp11One`](https://github.com/thisisnic/cpp_in_r/tree/main/cpp11One) - a minimal example of using C++ in an R package via the [cpp11](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/) package

* [`./cppSimpleFuncs`](https://github.com/thisisnic/cpp_in_r/tree/main/cppFuncs) - a slightly less minimal example; includes examples of inputs and outputs, for loops, conditionals, using the `.size()` method on a vector, using functions from the C++11 standard library

* [`./RcppOne`](https://github.com/thisisnic/cpp_in_r/tree/main/RcppOne) - a minimal example of using C++ in an R package via the Rcpp package

* [`./convolve`](https://github.com/thisisnic/cpp_in_r/tree/main/convolve) - an R package containing C and C++ (via Rcpp) code that do the same thing
